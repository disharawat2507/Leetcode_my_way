Welcome to my LeetCode repository! This project serves as a technical diary of my transition from Salesforce Development to Core Backend Engineering.

While Salesforce (Apex/SOQL) gave me a strong grasp of enterprise logic, I am now deep-diving into the fundamentals of computer science to build scalable, language-agnostic backend systems.

My Personal Approach: Code written the way I actually understood the logic.
Complexity Analysis: Rigorous $O(n)$ Time and $O(h)$ Space complexity analysis for every solution.
